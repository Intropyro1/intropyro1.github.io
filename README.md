# Hello
## Welcome to my Github Repo, meet me and my projects

## Two Projects so far shall be done, both will show my beginning journey
I would like these to represent the steps I'm taking in the journey, 
It took a while to get to this point, and I think it is a good point to document.
Enjoy the preview of more to come.
I will be adding more to each project, but for now, the logic behind them will show first, and then I will be working on more, adding as I go along.
I've built the habit of making comments within the code to explain my thinking

+DNA manipulator and RockPaperScissors... plus more
